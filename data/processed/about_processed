Contains the data that has been processed and is ready to be used by the machine learning models.
Usually, it contains the raw data split into train and test sets after some kind of preprocessing was applied.
This can include cases where the data was cleaned, had features engineered, or was otherwise preprocessed.

머신러닝 모델에 사용될 수 있도록 처리된 데이터를 보관하는 폴더이다.
주로, raw data를 preprocess한 후 train sets와 test sets로 나누어 저장한다.
