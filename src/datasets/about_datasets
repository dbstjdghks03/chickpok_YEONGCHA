This directory contains scripts that define how to load and handle the data used by the models.

It might also contain subdirectories such as dataset1 for additional separation in case of multiple datasets.

Each directory should contain at least two files:
dataset.py: Contains PyTorch's Dataset which allows for efficient and flexible data loading.
datamodule.py: ContainsPyTorch Lightingâ€™s LightningDataModule which organizes the data loading and preparation steps and
offers a clear and standardized interface for the data used in PyTorch Lightning systems.
