This directory contains scripts for running different parts of the project
, like "train.py" for training a model, "test.py" for testing, and "predict.py" for using a trained model to make predictions.

These scripts typically include PyTorch Lightningâ€™s Trainer class, which takes care of merging the LightningModule
with the mLightningDataModule, running specified callbacks such as EarlyStopping and Checkpointing
, and generally automating the entire machine learning process.
