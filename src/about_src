This is the root directory for all the source code related to the project.
Note that it also contains a subdirectory "ml" to further separate machine learning related code.
This is especially beneficial when the machine learning module needs to integrate with another module (for instance, a backend),
as it maintains a clean separation between different project modules, allowing team members to work on different parts simultaneously without interference.
